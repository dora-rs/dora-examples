# Simulation Configuration
# Main configuration file for DORA_NAV Phase 2 simulation

# Paths (relative to simulation folder)
paths:
  waypoints_file: "data/sample_waypoints.txt"
  map_pcd_file: "../data/map.pcd"           # Optional: point cloud map for visualization

# Initial vehicle state
initial_state:
  x: 0.0                      # Initial X position (meters)
  y: 0.0                      # Initial Y position (meters)
  theta: 0.0                  # Initial heading (radians, 0 = +X direction)
  velocity: 0.0               # Initial velocity (m/s)

# Simulation mode
mode:
  # Options: "path_follow", "manual", "replay"
  type: "path_follow"

  # For path_follow mode
  loop_path: false            # Loop back to start when path ends
  auto_start: true            # Start moving immediately

  # For replay mode (not implemented in Phase 2)
  trajectory_file: ""

# Output settings
output:
  log_to_file: false
  log_file: "simulation_log.csv"

# Debug settings
debug:
  print_state: false          # Print vehicle state to console
  print_rate: 5               # Print every N iterations
